# services.alljoyn-router

**Group:** Windows · **Improves:** Background & Cleanup · **Risk:** Moderate · **Evidence:** Plausible · **Scope:** Machine · **Reboot:** no

> Stops Windows running services and features you do not use. Frees some memory and boot time; does not, on its own, promise you frames.

## What it changes

The start type of the **`AJRouter`** service - AllJoyn Router Service - from `Automatic` to `Manual`, or from
whatever it currently is if something has already changed it, and stops the running
instance.

The service is not registered on every edition or every build. Where it is absent the
tweak reports itself as not applicable rather than failing.

## Mechanism

`AJRouter` routes messages for AllJoyn, an open Internet-of-Things interoperability protocol
that Microsoft built into Windows 10 and subsequently stopped developing.

## How much this is worth, honestly

It is a router for a protocol with essentially no deployed devices on a home network. It
starts, finds nothing to route, and idles.

This one appears in almost every debloat list, which is worth saying plainly: it appears there
because the name is unfamiliar and the service is easy to justify removing, not because anyone
measured it.

## Trade-off

AllJoyn devices stop being discoverable. In practice this means nothing, because almost
nothing shipped speaking it.

## What "Manual" and "Disabled" actually mean

`--set start=<option>`, or the radio buttons in the app.

| Option | Start type | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `manual` | `SERVICE_DEMAND_START` | **Default and recommended.** The service no longer starts at boot, but anything that asks for it can still start it. |
| `disabled` | `SERVICE_DISABLED` | The service cannot start at all. Anything that needs it fails. |

**Manual is a safety net.** If the reasoning on this page turns out to be wrong for your machine,
Manual means the service starts on demand and you never find out there was a problem. Disabled
means whatever needed it fails with an error naming neither the service nor this tool, weeks
after you ran it.

Pick `disabled` only after checking that the service keeps starting itself on Manual and
deciding you would rather it did not.

## What revert does

`nos revert <id>` restores the **exact** start type captured before the change, including the
difference between `Automatic` and `Automatic (Delayed Start)` - two settings the SCM reports
identically and that a "restore defaults" would collapse into one.

The service is not restarted by revert. Its start type says what should happen at the next boot,
and starting a service that was deliberately stopped is a larger intervention than a revert was
asked to make.

**Machine-scoped**, so it needs elevation: through the background service that costs no prompt,
from a portable copy it needs an elevated launch.
